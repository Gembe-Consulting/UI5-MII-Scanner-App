Feature: Interrupt Operation
	Users can Interrupt a process order operation
	
	Background:
		Given I start the app from 'com/mii/scanner/app/mockServer.html'
		  And I navigate to /VU
		
	Scenario: Should navigate to Interrupt Operation Page and see all UI elements
		Then I can see interruptOperationPage in action.InterruptOperation view
		 And I can see orderNumberInput in action.InterruptOperation view
		 And I can see operationNumberInput in action.InterruptOperation view
		 And I can see dateTimeEntry in action.InterruptOperation view
